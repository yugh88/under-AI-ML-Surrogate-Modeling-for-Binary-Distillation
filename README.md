##  Understanding the Results

### Performance Metrics Explained
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination):** Proportion of variance explained (closer to 1.0 is better)
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Average prediction error in original units
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):** Relative error as percentage
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error):** Emphasizes larger errors

### Industry Benchmarks
- **Distillate Purity (xD):** R² > 0.90 is excellent, MAE < 0.03 is industry standard
- **Reboiler Duty (QR):** R² > 0.70 is good for energy, MAPE < 15% is acceptable

### Model Interpretation
- **Gradient Boosting Winner:** Best balance of accuracy and robustness
- **Extrapolation Success:** Minimal performance degradation in untested regions
- **Physical Consistency:** Zero bounds violations, proper monotonic behavior

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Issue: Low Performance Results  
**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient training data
- Parameter bounds too restrictive
- Random seed differences

**Solution:**
```python
# Increase sample size
df = generate_distillation_data(n_samples=1000)

# Check data quality
print(f"Data range check: xD({df['xD'].min():.3f}-{df['xD'].max():.3f})")
```

#### Issue: Figures Not Displaying
**Solution:**
```bash
# For Jupyter notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# For scripts
plt.show()  # Add after plt.savefig()
```

#### Issue: Memory Errors
**Solution:**
- Reduce n_samples to 400-600
- Use 64-bit Python installation
- Close other applications

### Performance Optimization
```python
# For faster execution
n_jobs = -1  # Use all CPU cores in RandomForest/GradientBoosting
max_iter = 500  # Reduce neural network iterations for testing
```
